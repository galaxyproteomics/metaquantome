# metaQuant

Quantitative analysis of the function and taxonomy of microbiomes and their interaction.

# Roadmap

## High Priority
    - visualizations
    - document code better
    - configure Travis CI on Github
    - add option for specific rank in TF

## Lower Priority
    - think more about TF
    - which matters more - taxonomy or function?
    - use flake8 for codestyle

## Done
    - unified database structure and 'adding up'
        - unify this with classes
        - work on EC in particular
        - how do we implement for COG cats?
    - add handling if description is not found in database (EC)
