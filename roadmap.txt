TODO
HIGH PRIORITY
    - bioconda package
    - galaxy wrapper
    - checks on input, error handling
    - document functions


LOWER PRIORITY
    - additional functional ontologies in functional analysis (EC numbers and COG categories)
    - identification of functions/taxa/ft only present in one condition and not the other
    - think more about TF
    - which matters more - taxonomy or function?
