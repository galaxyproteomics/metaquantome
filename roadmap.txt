TODO
HIGH PRIORITY
change to ncbi taxid input, because it is unambiguous
  - translate to names at final step
  - build dataframe and then do rank-specific normalization, as before

LOWER PRIORITY
    - additional functional ontologies in functional analysis (EC numbers and COG categories)
    - identification of functions/taxa/ft only present in one condition and not the other
    - write arg parser
    - checks on input, error handling
    - document functions
    - think more about TF
    - which matters more - taxonomy or function?
