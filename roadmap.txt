refactor to minimize repeats:
    - in general, use functions rather than classes.
    - in progress

shared code:
    - filtering to minimum number of observations
    - volcano plot (TODO)
    - heatmap, especially for F+T (TODO)
    - tax and func share almost everything

other features:
    - additional functional ontologies in functional analysis (EC numbers and COG categories)
    - identification of functions/taxa/ft only present in one condition and not the other

other todo:
    - document functions
